  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm a Communication and Computer Engineering student at Mansoura University with a CGPA of 3.72, passionate about
    AI, Data Science, Business Analysis, and Full-Stack Development. My learning journey has been intentionally
    structured — I organize my year into 12-week challenges to stay focused, with dedicated time for growth and
    recovery.</p>
  <p>I've built a solid foundation in classical machine learning, data cleaning, and visualization using Matplotlib and
    Seaborn, and I've explored core deep learning models like CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and ANNs. My technical path includes
    hands-on learning from Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow, training through Samsung
    Innovation Campus's AI program, and ongoing development via DataCamp and Coursera.</p>
  <p>I also have a strong problem-solving background from my experience with the ICPC Mansoura club (Level 1), and I'm
    currently deepening my skills in business analysis through Kreativstorm's remote training program. At the same time,
    I'm tackling graduation projects and preparing for the IELTS exam with a target band score of 7.5.</p>
  <p>Curious, consistent, and always evolving — I'm committed to bridging the gap between data, business, and
    development to create smart, scalable solutions.</p>

      <h2>Sports & Physical Fitness:</h2>
      Playing sports is one of my favorite ways to unwind and stay active. I enjoy weight lifting, swimming, football,
      volleyball, table tennis, and running. These activities keep me energized and help maintain a balanced lifestyle.

      <h2>Self-Development & Lifelong Learning:</h2>
      I’m passionate about personal growth. I regularly watch self-development content on YouTube and read books like
      Atomic Habits, The Power of Habit, The One Thing, Thinking, Fast and Slow, and Rich Dad Poor Dad. I also enjoy
      Arabic novels, which offer both insight and cultural depth.

      <h2>Gaming:</h2>
      Video games are a fun escape for me. I especially enjoy shooter games and football titles like FIFA and PES, where
      I can relax, compete, and connect with friends.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Project-Based Learning & Engineering Curiosity:</h2>
      As a Communication and Computer Engineering student, I love tinkering with projects that bridge theory and
      practice. Whether it’s a graduation project or a personal build, I enjoy making things work and solving
      engineering challenges.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Planning & Goal Tracking:<h2>
          I approach my personal and professional development with structure—using 12-week challenges, rehab weeks, and
          weekly reflections to stay accountable and continuously grow.
